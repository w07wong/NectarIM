  	<h2>We decided that enough was enough.</h2>
  	<p>When we first came up with the idea for NectarIM, we were trying to solve a problem.  How can we collaborate during school without having to sneak onto our mail application during class?  That's when we had an epiphany.  Let's create a encrypted chat application that our school would allow.</p>
  	<h2>How we did it.</h2>
  		<p>Using Java, we created a whole new way of encrypting messages.  As part of our final project, we devoted a hundred percent of our time into developing a perfect, highly secure algorithm to protect your messages.</p>
